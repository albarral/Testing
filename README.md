# Sandbox2
Repository to be used by Migtron developers team for sharing test projects. 

Test projects are those used by developers to make their first steps on a new topic (say C++, Qt, MySQL ...). 
They are not related to any final application, and can be used by others in the team to get introduced in these topics.
